    "### Project Overview\n",
    "An international powerhouse, the film business brings in billions of dollars every year. According to Statista, the worldwide box office brought in an incredible $42.5 billion in 2019 alone. Film production, which include studios, independent producers, and streaming services, is the creative centre where motion pictures, television series, and other visual content are made. These works are marketed and delivered to theatres, streaming platforms, and other locations by the distribution division. The term \"exhibition\" describes the showing of films and television series in theatres. The allure of films is universal, bringing people from different origins together. Despite this widespread appeal, our individual film preferences are distinctive, ranging from romance to sci-fi to thrillers, and frequently focussing on our favourite actors and filmmakers."
